# Money Back Guarantee Contract

This contract adopts an iterative **"money back guarantee"** formula for the implementation of features and execution of activities identified and defined during our previous meetings.  

After your acceptance of this contract, we will start the production activities that are going to take place as follows:

1. A meeting is scheduled in order to prioritize all the planned features.

2. The working process will be divided in iterations of 1 week each; in each iteration, there will be a meeting with the client (face to face or with a conference call) during which implemented artifacts will be shown.

3. After each iteration, the client has the chance to accept the delivered artifact and go on to the following iteration or refuse the delivered artifact.
    * in the case of acceptance: we go on through the next iteration, choosing with the client the features to develop.

    * in the case of refusal, no cost will be charged to the client and the project will continue by repeating the iteration.

By the end of each iteration the client:

* Will have a working and usable version of the software in his hands in case of acceptance.

* Will have the chance to change the priority of the features that are going to be implemented in the  following iteration/s.

* Can decide to add/remove features from the backlog. A decrease in number of features will be matched by a decrease in number of needed iterations (and the price). As features backlog grows, so will the number of needed iterations (and so the price).

* Can decide to stop the project, with no development of the previously planned features, considered not necessary anymore; in this case only delivered iterations will be charged to the client.
